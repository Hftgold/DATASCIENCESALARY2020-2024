### Key Project Components:
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**:
   - **Dataset**: Analyzed a dataset containing various fields such as job titles, experience levels, employment types, work models, salary currencies, employee residences, company locations, and company sizes.
   - **Techniques**: Checked for unique values across categorical fields to understand the dataset's structure.
   - **Tools**: Utilized `pandas` for data manipulation.

2. **Data Visualization**:
   - **Salary Distribution**: Visualized the distribution of salaries in both USD and the original currencies.
   - **Insights**: Identified that salary distributions are right-skewed, indicating a concentration of salaries towards the lower end with some higher salaries extending the distribution tail.
   - **Tools**: Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create visualizations.

3. **Libraries and Tools Used**:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
