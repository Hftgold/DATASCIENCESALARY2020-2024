   - **Insights**: Identified that salary distributions are right-skewed, indicating a concentration of salaries towards the lower end with some higher salaries extending the distribution tail.
   - **Tools**: Used `matplotlib` and `seaborn` to create visualizations.

3. **Libraries and Tools Used**:
   - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis.
   - `matplotlib` and `seaborn` for data visualization.
